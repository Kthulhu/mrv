==============
The following people, countries and tools are mentioned because the helped during the development of the project in one way or another:

 * The people at ``WhiteSharkFilm AB`` (Stockholm, Sweden) who waited patiently for 3 months until the first actual feature came out of me - this is the time it took to get the first MRV version ready for their pipeline.
  * ``Sweden`` in general as its quite a dark and cold country most of the year making it easy to live in the office. Yes, thanks to Sweden :) !
 
 * ``Martin Freitag``, who survived me as a teacher, and generously converted his beloved AnimIO from MEL to MRV, providing it as a first demo tool from which others might be able to learn something.
 
 * ``Chad Dombrova`` who took the time for a first review of MRV, many of the issues he brought up helped me to greatly improve the 1.0.0 release.
  * ``PyMel`` for being a source of inspiration and for hinting me at more advanced python techniques without which MRV wouldn't be possible.
  
 * ``Python`` for being such a flexible and sometimes mind-bending language especially if you come from statically typed languages like C++, and for forcing me into Test-Driven-Development as MRV would be totally unreliable without it.
