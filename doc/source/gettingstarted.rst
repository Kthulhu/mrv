Getting Started

Besides the fact that you need to be familiar with Python, you should be able to get started with MRV quickly by working though the Usage Guide: :ref:`usage-label`.

****************
Helping Yourself
****************
MRV uses Sphinx as main documentation system, but uses Epydoc to fill the gap.

The sphinx documentation provides additional hand-manufactured documentation whereas the epydoc documentation pages are created from the source code only.

Besides sphinx's ability to mix auto-generated pages with hand-written ones, it has a search feature that proves extemely useful: :ref:`search`.

Most modules contain their own documentation. Module and Class doc strings are written in restructuredText to achieve nice formatting. Currently all functions are documented in epydoc style. 

The latter one works fine for epydoc, but looks awkward in this documentation. For your convenience, a link to the respective epydoc documentation page is provided on the top of each sphinx module docuemntation page.

In theory, you will never have to look into mrv's code yourself, even if code studies are desired, you could use the epydoc's 'source code' links to do so.
